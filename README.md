Daily Code Challenges ðŸš€
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Daily Code Challenges repository. This is my personal journey to sharpen my coding skills, stay consistent with problem-solving, and explore different algorithms and data structures.

I started this project to create a structured way to practice coding daily, while also tracking my progress over time.

Why Iâ€™m Doing This
I believe that consistent practice is the key to mastering coding. By solving one challenge a day, Iâ€™m:

Building a strong foundation in problem-solving.
Gaining hands-on experience with algorithms and data structures.
Exploring new ways to tackle complex problems.
This repository is both my personal practice log and a way to share my solutions with others who might find them helpful.

How It Works
Every day, I:

Fetch or generate a new coding challenge.
Solve the problem and document my thought process.
Commit the solution here to keep myself accountable.
Automation
Iâ€™ve set up GitHub Actions to fetch or generate a new challenge automatically every day. It saves the challenge in the challenges/ folder, so I can dive right in when I start coding.

What Youâ€™ll Find Here
Repository Structure
challenges/: The daily challenges, organized by date.
solutions/: My solutions, with explanations of the approach I used.
scripts/: The automation scripts that keep everything running smoothly.
Getting Started
If youâ€™d like to try solving some of these challenges or follow along:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-code-challenges.git
cd daily-code-challenges
Check out the latest challenge in the challenges/ folder.
Write your own solution, or compare it with mine in the solutions/ folder.
How I Solve Challenges
When tackling a challenge, I usually follow these steps:

Read the problem carefully and break it into smaller parts.
Plan the solution using pseudocode or diagrams.
Code the solution and test it with various cases.
Refactor the code for readability and efficiency.
Write down my approach and any learnings.
Whatâ€™s Next?
Here are some features Iâ€™m planning to add:

Streak Tracker: Visualize my coding streaks over time.
Platform Integration: Pull challenges directly from LeetCode or Codewars.
Interactive Solutions: Add visualizations or walkthroughs for complex problems.
Letâ€™s Collaborate!
If you:

Have a cool problem I should try.
See a better way to solve one of my challenges.
Just want to share your thoughts...
Feel free to reach out or open an issue. Iâ€™m always up for learning and collaborating!
