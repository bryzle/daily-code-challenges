# **Daily Code Challenges ðŸš€**

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my **Daily Code Challenges** repository. This is my personal journey to sharpen my coding skills, stay consistent with problem-solving, and explore different algorithms and data structures. 

I started this project to create a structured way to practice coding daily, while also tracking my progress over time.

---

## **Why Iâ€™m Doing This**

I believe that consistent practice is the key to mastering coding. By solving one challenge a day, Iâ€™m:
- Building a strong foundation in problem-solving.
- Gaining hands-on experience with algorithms and data structures.
- Exploring new ways to tackle complex problems.

This repository is both my personal practice log and a way to share my solutions with others who might find them helpful.

## **How It Works**

Every day, I:
1. Fetch or generate a new coding challenge.
2. Solve the problem and document my thought process.
3. Commit the solution here to keep myself accountable.

### **Automation**
Iâ€™ve set up **GitHub Actions** to fetch or generate a new challenge automatically every day. It saves the challenge in the `challenges/` folder, so I can dive right in when I start coding.

## **What Youâ€™ll Find Here**

### **Repository Structure**
- **`challenges/`**: The daily challenges, organized by date.
- **`solutions/`**: My solutions, with explanations of the approach I used.
- **`scripts/`**: The automation scripts that keep everything running smoothly.
